Function 3 - Long Planeteer Calls

1. The longPlaneteerCalls method should accept an array of calls. The function should tell us if any of the calls are longer than four characters. For example:

  shortWords = ["wind", "fire"]
  longPlaneteerCalls(short_words)
  #=> false
 
  assortedWords = ["earth", "wind", "heart", "fire"]
  longPlaneteerCalls(assorted_words)
  #=> true

2. Notice the return value of this method is either false or true, depending on the array it was given as an argument.
