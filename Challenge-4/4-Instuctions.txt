Method 4 - Find the Cheese

1. The "findTheCheese" function should accept an array of strings. It should then look through these strings and return the first string that is a type of cheese. The types of cheese that appear are cheddar, gouda, and camembert.

  snacks = ["crackers", "gouda", "thyme"]
  findTheCheese(snacks)
  #=> "gouda"
  
  soup = ["tomato soup", "cheddar", "oyster crackers", "gouda"]
  findTheCheese(soup)
  #=> "cheddar"

2. If, sadly, a list of ingredients does not include cheese, return "no cheese!":

  ingredients = ["garlic", "rosemary", "bread"]
  findTheCheese(ingredients)
  #=> "no cheese!"
